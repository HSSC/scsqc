South Carolina Surgical Quality Collaborative
==============================================

Introduction
------------

Data from Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) is being used Surgical Quality Collaborative  (SQC) to
benefit the sites that are participating in this initiative. Initial data use is meant for 
three participating sites with lead surgeons and nurses to analyze and establish goals and outcomes. 
Data is made available in a safe and secure manner to a lead surgeon and lead nurse through the 
`QCMetrix interface <https://www.qcmetrix.com/>`_ for collaborative use based on the 
data usage agreement. In a subsequent phase of this project, additional data from the sites
will be hosted in CDW for potential uses like data requests for research with an IRB approval.
