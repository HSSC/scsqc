Support
=======

This project has no outward facing customer support due to it's internal nature.
Extraction of payload and response from QCMetrix are automated to occur on a 
periodic (nightly) basis for each participating site. Updates are automatically
collected. If payloads fail currently there is no mechanism for automatic recovery.
A way to resolve the issues is to reach out to the following mailing lists seeking
support. 

 * QCMetrix Support: support@qcmetrix.com
 * HSSC Support: support@healthsciencessc.org
